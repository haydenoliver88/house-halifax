# Balancing Density and Expansion: Housing Supply Decisions in Halifax

## Decision Statement
Should the Halifax Regional Municipality’s planning director prioritize densification incentives or greenfield development to address housing affordability over the next five years?

## Executive Summary
Halifax is experiencing sustained population growth driven by immigration, interprovincial migration, and demographic shifts, placing increasing pressure on its housing market. Rising home prices and rental costs have intensified affordability concerns for residents, while supply struggles to keep pace with demand. The planning director of the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) faces a critical decision: whether to prioritize densification within existing urban areas or continue expanding housing supply through greenfield development on the city’s outskirts.

This decision is complex due to competing economic, social, and environmental considerations. Densification can increase housing supply more efficiently and leverage existing infrastructure, but it often faces public resistance and zoning constraints. Greenfield development can deliver housing quickly and at lower upfront costs, yet it risks urban sprawl, infrastructure strain, and long-term environmental impacts. Budget limitations, political pressures, and long-term sustainability goals further complicate the choice.

The outcome of this decision will shape housing affordability, transportation patterns, infrastructure costs, and environmental outcomes in Halifax for decades. Framing the issue as a systems-based decision highlights the feedback loops between housing supply, prices, population growth, infrastructure demand, and public acceptance—underscoring why data-informed decision-making is essential.
